I am a student and amateur human, still trying to get used to the reality. BSc in Nanotechnology, hopefully future MSc in Teaching of physics - chemistry for secondary schools. Linux user for 3-4 years, gradually progressing towards the initial "source" OS (Mint->Ubuntu->Debian). 1.5 year experience with VASP.
